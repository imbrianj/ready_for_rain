# Ready For Nature

Checks for upcoming inclement weather and alerts you if you have doors or windows open.

This SmartThings app is a fork of [Ready for Rain](https://github.com/imbrianj/ready_for_rain), with the following enhancements:

* An option to check the hourly forecast instead of the whole day forecast, which is useful during days with changeable weather.
* The ability to send TTS alerts to a configured media speaker (devices with **capability.musicPlayer**)
* An option to check the Air Quality Index via the U.S. EPA [AirNow API](https://docs.airnowapi.org/) in addition to (or instead of) the rain forecast.

## Setup

1. Install the app into the IDE via GitHub integration (if you have this configured), or the via the old fashioned way of pasting the code into the **New SmartApp** > **From Code** window.
2. If you plan to use the Air Quality check, you will need to:
    1. [Request a free AirNow API key](https://docs.airnowapi.org/account/request/)
    2. [Log in](https://docs.airnowapi.org/login) to the AirNow API website.
    3. Visit any of the Web Services documentation pages (e.g. [Forecast by Zip Code](https://docs.airnowapi.org/forecastsbyzip/docs)) and look for **Your API Key:** in the top right of the page.
    
       It should be a string of hexadecimal characters in the format **XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX**. If you see your API key simply listed as GUEST, that's not it. The main AirNow Web Services index page currently has a bug that shows this as the key even when logged in. Try one of the subpages.
    
       Copy the key to the clipboard.
    4. Go to the SmartThings IDE > My SmartApps > Ready For Nature and click on **App Settings** in the top right.
    5. Click **Settings** and paste in your API key in the **Value** box next to **airNowKey**
3. Once installed into the IDE, add and configure for your hub via the SmartThings mobile app.
